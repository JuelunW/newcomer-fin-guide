            <h1>Digi- ja v√§est√∂tietovirasto (DVV)</h1>
            <p>Registering with DVV is a crucial first step for anyone moving to Finland permanently or temporarily.
                This guide will walk you through the process of registering for personal identity code and request a
                municipality of residence.
            </p>

            <h2>What is DVV?</h2>
            <p>The Digital and Population Data Services Agency (DVV) is a Finnish government agency responsible for
                maintaining the Population Information System. This system contains data on all residents of
                Finland, including foreigners who have registered their place of residence. Getting registered with
                the DVV is a fundamental step to access public services, open a bank account, and handle official
                matters in Finland.
            </p>
            <h2>What is personal identification code?</h2>
            <p>Personal identity code is commonly referred to as social security number in everyday language. Your
                personal identity code (henkil√∂tunnus) is probably the most important piece of information that you
                will receive and need in Finland. It is an 11-digit code that contains your date of birth and
                other identifiers. If you have not received a personal identity code from Migri or Vero, you can
                apply for it at The Digital and Population Data Services Agency (DVV).
            </p>
            <h2>What is municipality of residence?</h2>
            <p>Your municipality of residence is the municipality where you live. You are not automatically
                registered as a resident of a certain locality when you receive a personal identity code. You can
                request for a municipality of residence in Finland at DVV. Having a municipality of residence in
                Finland gives you access to local public services such as daycare, schools, healthcare as well as
                public transport at a lower cost. Municipality of residence is also required if you want to get a
                Finnish identity card or a driving license.
